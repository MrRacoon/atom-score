# atom-score package

A plugin for the Atom editor, to provide instant feedback during to your workflow.

It's hard to break habits. And it's fun to play games. Let's build a system to keep track of your coding habits, and try to sway you into better habits with points.

For instance:

> You want to learn to be more vigilant about keeping code folds 'folded'

so if I give you 2 points for closing folds, and **take 2 points** everytime you open a fold. You should eventually learn to close every fold you open?

TBO, I don't actually know the answer to that. That's why I built this experiment :)

## Setup

Currently, this package is undergoing rapid development. Don't feel it's mature enough atm to go on the atom package site. Until then you can play with the early stuff with:

```
git clone https://github.com/mrracoon/atom-score.git
cd atom-score
apm link
```

## Contributions

Pull requests always welcome.
